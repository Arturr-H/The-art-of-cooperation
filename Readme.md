# The art of Cooperation

I'm trying to replicate a "Social experiment" reddit made a couple years ago. It's called [r/place](https://reddit.com/r/place).
Every redditor got to place one pixel each every 5 minutes, and could chose its position and color however they liked on the large canvas.

## Why?

I'd like to improve my websocket skills and would like to practice writing backend.
